Wine Quality Prediction Using KNN Algorithm
Wine quality prediction involves the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. One effective method for this task is the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. KNN is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm that classifies data based on the similarity between the target and its nearest neighbors.
Steps for Wine Quality Prediction Using KNN
Data Collection: Gather a dataset that includes various chemical properties of wines along with their quality ratings. An example dataset is the Wine Quality dataset, which consists of red and white wine samples with attributes like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, scaling the features, and splitting the data into training and test sets. Scaling is crucial for KNN as it is sensitive to the magnitude of the data.

Choosing K: Select an appropriate value of 'k'. The value of 'k' can significantly affect the performance of the KNN algorithm. Typically, 'k' is chosen through cross-validation to find the value that results in the highest accuracy.

Model Training: Train the KNN model on the training dataset. The model will store the training data and use it to make predictions for new data points.

Prediction: Use the trained KNN model to predict the quality of wine samples in the test set. For each test sample, the algorithm identifies the 'k' nearest neighbors from the training set and assigns the quality based on the majority quality rating of these neighbors.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices can also provide insights into the prediction accuracy for each class.
