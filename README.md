# Wine Quality Prediction Using KNN

This project predicts wine quality based on chemical properties using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model classifies wine samples into quality ratings, utilizing similarity-based learning techniques.

## Repository Contents
- **Code**: Implementation of the KNN algorithm for training and prediction.
- **Data**: The Wine Quality dataset containing red and white wine samples with attributes like acidity, sugar levels, pH, alcohol content, etc.
- **Documentation**: Explanation of preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilizes the Wine Quality dataset for model training and evaluation.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scales features, and splits data into training and test sets.
- **Model Training**: Trains the KNN algorithm to predict wine quality based on chemical attributes.
- **Prediction and Evaluation**: Predicts wine quality and evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage
